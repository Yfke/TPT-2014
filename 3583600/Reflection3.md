Grade: 7/10

Question 1 is correct.

Question 2 is correct.

Question 3 and 4 are correct. The non-regular alternatives that I wrote down are a lot easier to come up with, are also correct so it is quite puzzling why one would ever use Regular
functions in non-academic settings.

I could not get agda installed properly (parse errors during the compilation of BOOL.agda).
