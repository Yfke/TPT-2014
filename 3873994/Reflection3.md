### Exercise 1                   
* OK

### Exercise 2    
                        
* The example in 2d would not compile and is ambiguous, because I forgot the condition or the then case. Reduced 0.1 points, for sloppyness, since I forgot to write the condition.

### Exercise 3                       
* OK

### Exercise 4                    
* I do not see why you should write the class Subelems since you can use the class Children. The question states we need to write a generic function, but parents is a generic function, so this solution is correct.

### Exercise 5                   
* Very similar. Did not prove isoμ₁. Reduced 0.5 points.
