# Reflection

## Exercise 2a

- I have left a couple of holes. One implicit argument was actually easy to fix.

- In small-to-big I have accidentally inlined an iteration of prepend-step

- Although I like how you can see what happens in my bigstep-sound proof, the reference solution seems easier to extend / modify

Filling the holes and extending the proofs: `3`.
Adding pairs to the language: `2.5`.

# Exercise 2b

- normalizableStep is unneccesarily complicated; it needs no case analysis on the steps inside Halts

`2.7` points (of 3).

# Total

1 + 3 + 2.5 + 2.7 = 9.2
